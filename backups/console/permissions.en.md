title: User Permissions
---

The Shiva console allows for precise user rights management within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, the main account of the sponsor enables the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer the permissions of other users.

## Available Permissions for Users in Your Organization
The following permissions are configurable for each [user](accounts.md#affectation-des-permissions-Ã -un-utilisateur) and for each [tenant](tenants.md#selection-dun-tenant) within your organization.

- 'Read' type permissions are associated with consultation without the possibility of configuration.
- 'Write' type permissions are associated with modification of the configuration.
- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permissions to alter a configuration.

**Notes**:

- *There is no limit on the number of owners that can be set on the tenant. However, the management interface (IHM) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security reasons and optimal access management.*
- *When a new owner is added, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes. This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.*
- *To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support. This procedure guarantees that the changes in access rights are made securely and in compliance with best access management practices.*

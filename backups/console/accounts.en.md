title: Shiva Console Access Accounts
---

The Shiva console access accounts are created by the sponsoring master account upon invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).
The credentials are global to your [Organization](organisations.md).

*__Nota:__ [Identity Federation is managed at the organization level](organisations.md#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

## Creating a user account in your organization
Creating a user account within your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](organisations.md), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left of your screen on the green banner, then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the user page.

Then enter the user's email address.

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once the verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

## Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user page.

By default, a user has no rights. It is therefore necessary for the administrator who invited the user to grant the necessary rights for their activities. Simply click on the __'Actions'__ menu of the user and choose the __'Modify'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

The configuration of permissions must be done for each [Tenant](tenants.md) of the [Organisation](organisations.md).

The list of permissions and their definition can be accessed [here](permissions.md).

## Change a user's language
Changing the language of a user is to be done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

The configuration is set for each tenant [Tenant](tenants.md).

## Subscription to Thematic Notifications
Subscription management enables you to receive emails related to activated themes, which will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, under the "My subscriptions" tab:

For instance, in the event of an incident, email notifications specific to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and may be progressively enriched to adapt to needs and shifts in our operational environment.

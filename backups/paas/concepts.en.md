## Objectives

The __'PaaS'__ platform of Cloud Temple aims to allow our clients to operate their digital transformation programs with ease, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

The services associated with this platform are as follows:

- Containerization in partnership with __REDHAT__ via the __'[OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)'__ platform,
- Transactional object storage in partnership with __DELL__ via the __'[ECS](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/storage/ecs/index.htm?hve=explore+ecs)'__ platform,
- Encryption in partnership with __THALES__.

These services will gradually be opened for commercialization in the first quarter of 2024.
## Object Storage Platform

### Overview

Object storage is distinguished by its robustness, enhanced security, and scalability, providing continuous access to your data. This system is ideal for archiving information in the cloud, ensuring availability from any location.

It efficiently meets the needs of businesses requiring voluminous and diverse management of digital files.

Launched in 2006 by Amazon Web Services (AWS), __Simple Storage Service (S3)__ has become the de facto standard for object storage in the world of cloud computing.

The S3 object storage is characterized by its __elasticity__, automatically adjusting storage capacities according to data volume fluctuations. This flexibility allows users to manipulate files without worrying about capacity constraints, thus optimizing the archiving process while ensuring quick and efficient access to information.

The __data security__ is ensured by multi-layer protection strategies, including the use of encrypted access keys, data encryption in transit and at rest, as well as the rigorous management of access rights.

Moreover, the seamless integration of S3 object storage with other cloud services enriches and facilitates the developer experience thanks to a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries that ease integration into existing applications and workflows.

### Use cases

Cloud Temple's object storage presents itself as a prime solution for __secondary or tiered storage__, offering an economical alternative for archiving __less frequently accessed data__, such as database backups or large files, from more expensive primary storage.

For the development and deployment of applications, Cloud Temple's object storage facilitates the __development of next-generation web, mobile, and cloud applications__.

As a foundation for __creating a Data Lake__, Cloud Temple's object storage allows businesses across all sectors to maximize the value of their data. It incorporates high-performance HDFS services, offering on-premise advanced analysis capabilities to improve decision-making while minimizing risks and delays.

Based on the __Dell ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage)__ solution, Cloud Temple's object storage is enriched by strategic partnerships with various publishers, such as __Databricks__ and __ChapsVision__, thus increasing the scope of its object storage solutions.

For the field of __Internet of Things (IoT)__, it stands out for its ability to handle an unlimited volume of objects, without restrictions on the size of the objects or metadata, making it the ideal platform for IoT data storage.

Cloud Temple's object storage also offers a secure solution for __long-term data archiving and retention__, meeting the retention needs of businesses.

It is particularly suitable for hosting __static content__, such as images, scripts, and CSS stylesheets, optimizing web application performance by offloading application servers and optimizing content downloading to end users.

Finally, as an essential component of __backup and disaster recovery__ (DRaaS) strategies, Cloud Temple's object storage allows for regular and reliable backup of critical data. Its multi-site distributed structure ensures data availability at all times, thus reducing business interruptions and potential data loss.
## RedHat OpenShift Platform
### Overview

__RedHat OpenShift__ is an application containerization platform based on __Kubernetes__, which automates the deployment, management, and scaling of applications in a trusted cloud environment.

Designed for developers and IT teams, it provides a consistent and secure development, testing, and production environment for cloud-native and traditional monolithic applications.

__RedHat OpenShift__ eases the work of DevOps engineers by integrating development tools, automated testing, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes to accelerate the application development lifecycle. It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, allowing developers to work with the technologies they know and love.

The platform provides a highly available and secure container infrastructure, relying on best security practices and offering features such as integrated authentication, authorization, and role-based access control. __RedHat OpenShift__ also enables fine-grained resource management, ensuring that applications have the necessary resources to operate optimally.

With __RedHat OpenShift__, businesses can easily deploy their applications in a hybrid cloud environment, benefiting from the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud.

### Use cases

__RedHat OpenShift__ is utilized in a variety of use cases, due to its flexibility, security, and extensive ecosystem. Here are some of the main use cases:

1. **Cloud-native application development:** OpenShift is ideal for developing and deploying applications designed specifically for the cloud, using microservices architectures, containers, and managed services. This allows developers to focus on creating features rather than managing infrastructure.

2. **Modernization of existing applications:** Companies use OpenShift to modernize their traditional monolithic applications by refactoring them into microservices or containerizing them to improve scalability, resilience, and portability.

3. **Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD):** OpenShift facilitates the implementation of CI/CD pipelines, allowing automatic code integration and deployment, thus reducing human errors and accelerating the application development lifecycle.

4. **IT operations automation:** With its close integration with Kubernetes, OpenShift allows for the automated management of containers, including their deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management, freeing IT operators from repetitive tasks.

5. **Multi-cloud and hybrid development:** OpenShift offers the flexibility to deploy applications in on-premise, public, private, or hybrid environments, allowing businesses to choose the most suitable approach for their needs without being locked into a single cloud provider.

6. **Large-scale and high-availability applications:** OpenShift is designed to support applications requiring high availability, large scale, and high performance, thanks to its efficient resource management and ability to replicate applications across multiple nodes.

7. **IoT application development and deployment:** OpenShift can be used to develop and deploy IoT applications, benefiting from its ability to handle a large number of real-time connections and data.

8. **Big Data and analytical applications:** With support for solutions like Apache Spark on Kubernetes, OpenShift enables the processing of large amounts of data and the execution of complex analyses, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making.

9. **Development and testing environments:** OpenShift provides isolated and reproducible environments for application development and testing, reducing conflicts between teams and improving code quality.

These use cases illustrate the versatility of OpenShift as a platform that not only accelerates application development and deployment but also supports the digital transformation of businesses across various industry sectors.

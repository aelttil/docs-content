The **S3 object storage** is a key solution for managing large-scale unstructured data, such as files, documents, or databases. Based on the standard AWS S3 protocol, this technology provides a resilient and scalable architecture, allowing for efficient storage, security, and access to data via REST APIs. Each file, referred to as an "object", is contained in a "bucket", a logical space for organizing data and defining access rules.
Cloud Temple's object storage infrastructure is based on Dell's **Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS)** solution, known for its compatibility with the S3 protocol and its high performance. This solution guarantees exceptional availability and durability through advanced techniques such as **Erasure Coding** and replication across multiple availability zones. With a **97% compatibility with AWS S3**, it provides a smooth transition and standardized management for businesses.

To secure data, Cloud Temple offers advanced encryption options: **server-side** (with keys managed by Cloud Temple or by the client) or **client-side**, giving the user full control. Certified **SecNumCloud**, **HDS**, and **ISO 27001**, this infrastructure ensures strict compliance with regulatory requirements and the highest security standards.

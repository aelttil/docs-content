The __IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service)__ offer from Cloud Temple is designed to meet critical continuity and disaster recovery needs, with a particular focus on demanding sectors such as industry, banking, and insurance. Based on cutting-edge technologies, this infrastructure guarantees maximum availability and optimal performance for your critical workloads.

## A Reliable Technological Platform

Cloud Temple's IaaS platform relies on internationally renowned technological partners:

- Compute: **CISCO UCS**.
- Storage: **IBM Spectrum Virtualize**, **IBM FlashSystem** for block storage, and **DELL ECS** for object storage.
- Network: **JUNIPER**.
- Virtualization: **Open Source Stack**, providing a reliable and proven base to manage your cloud environments.

This architecture is based on the **VersaStack** model, an alliance between Cisco and IBM, ensuring extensive compatibility with major software vendors.

## A Dedicated and Automated Infrastructure

Although fully automated through APIs and a Terraform provider, Cloud Temple's IaaS offer provides a unique infrastructure:

- **Dedicated resources**: Compute blades, storage volumes, and software stacks (virtualization, backup, firewalling, etc.) are never shared between clients.
- **Maximum predictability**: You control the virtualization rates, IOPS pressure on storage, and benefit from clear, monthly usage-based billing.

The platform is **SecNumCloud** qualified by the [ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/), guaranteeing a high level of automation and security.

## Key Features

- On-demand dedicated compute resources (CPU, RAM).
- On-demand storage (several classes available).
- Network resources (Internet, private networks).
- Cross-backups with configurable retention.
- Asynchronous replication for storage or virtual machines.
- Management via the [Shiva Console](../console/console.md) or in Infrastructure as Code mode thanks to APIs and the Terraform provider.

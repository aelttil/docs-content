title: Shiva Console Access Accounts
---

Shiva console access accounts are created by the sponsorâ€™s master account via invitation (regardless of the authentication directory).
Identification information is global to your [Organization](organisations.md).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](organisations.md#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

## Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](organisations.md), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen on the green banner, and then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the user page.

Next, enter the user's email address

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once the verification is complete, the user can log in to the console.

## Assigning Permissions to a User

User rights management is done from the user page.

By default, a user has no rights. Therefore, it is necessary for the administrator who sent the invitation to grant the user the necessary permissions for their activity. Simply click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and select the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu will then appear:

Permission configuration is to be done for each [Tenant](tenants.md) of the [Organization](organisations.md).

The list of permissions and their definitions is accessible [here](permissions.md).

## Changing a User's Language
Changing a user's language is done in their __'Profile'__, located at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

The configuration is done for each tenant [Tenant](tenants.md).

## Subscription to Thematic Notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to the activated themes, which will be automatically sent when related events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, under the "My Subscriptions" tab:

For example, in the event of an incident, email notifications specific to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is likely to evolve and gradually expand to adapt to the needs and changes in our operational environment.

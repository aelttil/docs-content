title: User Permissions
---

The Shiva console enables fine-grained user rights management within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the client's main account that allows for the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer the permissions of other users.

## Available permissions for users in your organization

The following permissions can be configured for each [user](accounts.md#affectation-des-permissions-Ã -un-utilisateur) and for each [tenant](tenants.md#selection-dun-tenant) in your organization.

- __'read'__ type permissions are associated with viewing without the ability to configure
- __'write'__ type permissions are associated with configuration modification.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ Therefore, it is necessary to have the READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.

**Notes** :

- *There is no limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant. However, the management interface (UI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.*
- *When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes. This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.*

- *To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a support request. This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are performed securely and in accordance with best access management practices.*

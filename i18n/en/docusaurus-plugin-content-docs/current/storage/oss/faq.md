### What is the maximum file size that can be handled with the web console?

The web limit is 40MB per file. Beyond that, you need to use a native S3 client with the API.

### Which S3 client can I use to manage my files?
The main S3 clients are compatible. Minio, aws cli, WINSCP, ...

### Does the Cloud Temple S3 offer use the 'PathStyle' or 'UrlStyle' method?

Due to the constraints associated with SecNumCloud qualification, at this time, the offer is designed to use the '**PathStyle**' method. We are working to make the '**UrlStyle**' method available in Q1 2025.

### What is the maximum number of buckets per tenant?

The maximum number of buckets for 1 tenant is 999.

### How to add the HASH of a file when uploading an object?
Overall, file HASH is supported on our object storage via metadata. Some clients allow for on-the-fly HASH calculation and addition as metadata (minio-mc with md5 for example), for others, the data must be specified directly in the metadata.

1. Case of adding a HASH with the minio-mc client: this client supports on-the-fly calculation of an MD5 hash and storage in metadata

### How is Cloud Temple's S3 offer billed?

The price is a monthly rate, per GiB of storage, billed monthly. However, the platform accounts for usage by the hour and performs billing on a monthly basis of 720 hours.

For example, if you consume 30 GiB for 1 hour in a month, then nothing, then a few days later 30 GiB for 2 hours, the monthly bill will be *( Price (1 x 30GiB) + 2 x Price (30GiB) ) / 720* for the considered month. Billing is due at the end of the term.

and any entity, whether a natural or legal person, acting as a consumer or professional, 
private or public law, having subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offer 
in accordance with the SecNumCloud Reference Framework (hereinafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**"). 

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Provider are respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and as "Parties" when mentioned together.

## 4. Purpose

The purpose of this Contract is to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, the methods of execution of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT enters into this contract in their own name and on their own behalf.
The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTC), which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, they are strongly advised to seek the expertise of a specialist in IT and networks before accepting these terms. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection of the characteristics of the proposed work units and the determination of the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party agrees not to make commitments on behalf of and for the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, 
this provision will be considered as unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract or the strength of the other provisions.

## 6. Service Ordering

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. 
In the context of creating and managing this account, the CLIENT undertakes to provide the Provider with all the necessary data for the 
proper execution of the contract. These data include, but are not limited to, email address, identity and contact information,
as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, 
this third party must attest and assure the Service Provider that they have the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and commit them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Before the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify 
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents
for the information provided. The Service Provider also has the right to refuse activation or to proceed with deactivation.
of the CLIENT Account in the event that the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested, 
orders can be made via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account, 
including securing the authentication means (usernames, passwords, etc.) associated with it. 

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered as having been made by the CLIENT themselves, and fully adheres to the terms of the Contract.
The terms and delivery times for the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after
that the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to ensure that the terms of service provision meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. However, in case of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence 
will be given to the documents in the order they were listed. The annexes of the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict 
the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Contract duration

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (T&Cs) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise stipulated 
in the Specific Conditions that would provide for a fixed term.
Termination of the Contract is only possible by adhering to the procedures specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure 
the complete recovery of their data that was stored under the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article 
related to "Data Recovery and Erasure".

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay for the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the order form,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated appendices.
## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain optional services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them later.
The provision of any optional service by the Provider is subject to the prior agreement of the parties following a joint evaluation.

## 10. Terms of Service Use

### 10.1. Compliance with service terms

The CLIENT is obliged to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use. 
The use of the Services must be done responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize themselves with the 
General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTC) in force and to comply with all guidelines provided to them at the time of the order. 

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use
by the latter, to make them aware of and accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Provider of the full respect 
of these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully review the current Terms of Use, 
as well as to thoroughly analyze all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, with the aim of choosing Services and features 
that precisely match their needs and those of third parties using the Services on their behalf or for their account. 

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent in the activities carried out 
via the use of the Services. For any request for information related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about potential changes, particularly when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires the CLIENT to have, at their own expense and under their responsibility, an adequate remote connection 
(such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical fluctuations 
and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the scope of the Services. 

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators 
(including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.),
or potential repercussions of these malfunctions, especially when they lead to unavailability or interruption of Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary 
to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best 
security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences 
resulting from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication methods assigned to users. 

Under no circumstances can the Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to notify the Provider 
without delay in the event of such incidents.
In the event of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means, it is necessary to immediately initiate procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Service Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, 
except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of Services. Thus, the Service Provider does not carry out any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned content. 

Similarly, it does not provide a dedicated backup of the content stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures for 
the backup of their content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, particularly through the use of appropriate work units in the Service Provider's catalog.
Managed content must be legal and used in accordance with best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. 
The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content that glorifies crimes, 
incites hatred or violence against individuals because of their sex, religion, orientation or sexual identity, or disability, or violates 
others' intellectual property rights) is strictly prohibited. 

Any breach of these rules may result in the immediate suspension of Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, 
or even termination of the Contract at the sole discretion of the Provider. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages for suffered harm.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain vigilant to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and resources provided, which may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, and could affect the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the resources provided, with the exception of penetration tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. Any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices.
4. The use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in the event of:

1. A real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. Implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. Requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. Alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. Violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension can be immediate, without notice, in case of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, an infringement of third party rights, or any act that could potentially engage the Provider's liability.
The Provider strives, as far as possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT is kept informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet their obligations, these suspensions will be carried out without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are solely due to a failure on the part of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as a service unavailability for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Provider reserves the right, at its discretion, to make any changes to the Services, including the addition, modification, or removal of ranges, options, features, as well as performance improvements. A detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about updates to the Services, which will immediately apply to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications to third-party products.

In accordance with the "Specific Conditions for Consumers" article, if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a performance decrease —, the CLIENT has the right to terminate the concerned Service. To do this, they must send a termination notification 
by registered mail with a request for acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual property and usage rights

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property 
of the Provider or its rights holders. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, 
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to underline that, 
aside from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions and rights for the elements.
and contents (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that he chooses to use or operate as part of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits to not exploit these contents 
for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with current laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software, 
codes, and algorithms made available as part of the Services, including for reverse engineering attempts, except for explicit legal 
authorization allowing to bypass this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Provider 
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if they plan to use the Services or allow their use by third parties outside of European borders, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities in these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including solvency and the potential presence of the CLIENT
on sanction lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Treasury Directorate, may be carried out. Following these checks, 
the Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party Products provided as part of the Services. 
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers 
no warranty for these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc., 
2. the CLIENT's use of Third-Party Products is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. In particular, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling,
to gain access to source codes, or to reinstall Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. 
The responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability with their specific needs and the objectives pursued, 
while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuity and reversibility of services

The termination of Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, 
the interruption of Services by the CLIENT, the violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, 
result in the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements)
that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, broadcast, published, or otherwise used or exploited as part of the Services, 
including any potential backups.

### 10.13. Intrusion Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically mandated external auditor, intrusion tests on the provided Services 
(hereinafter referred to as "Intrusion Tests"). These tests can only be carried out after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved 
in the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, as well as their subcontractors if applicable. 
These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Intrusion Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor,
reiterating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility 
of the CLIENT. Penetration Tests must in no case:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or of the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal operation of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising 
from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions carried out by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups 
before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.
It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, which may result in a temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party affected by this unavailability. At the end of the intrusion tests, an audit report will be written and made available to the Service Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of vulnerability discovery).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written permission of the Service Provider. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration


The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to a duty of cooperation. Consequently, they commit to communicate all information and documents that may facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more specifically, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each of the Parties declares and guarantees that they possess the authority and capacity necessary for the conclusion of the Contract and the execution of the obligations incumbent upon them. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee in particular that they have all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (including technical), allowing them respectively to use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions provided in the Contract.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as a lump sum compensation for
any damage resulting from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action in this regard. 
If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation chargeable to the Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT 
for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation claim.

**Disclaimer Clause:** The Provider's liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-execution, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or negligence on the part of the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decrease in activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or customers, particularly due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, a lawsuit from a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use", including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, to the extent that the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly with regard to the sensitivity of the data involved);

## 14. Financial Terms

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of the invoice issuance, in accordance with the terms agreed upon at the time of the Contract signing. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Service Provider offers various pricing grids for its
Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that suits them best when placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, which means that VAT and any other relevant tax (excluding the Provider's income taxes) are added to the billed amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price modification in the sense of the article dedicated to the conditions of tariff revision.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of the Services also includes the fees related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights for the tools, software, and operating systems used by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any license or usage rights necessary for the operation of the content they use via the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used to calculate these prices are available on the Provider's website. 
It is recommended that the CLIENT consults this information before validating their order. Any unit of measurement started is due in its entirety, 
even if it is not fully consumed. In addition, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its prices at its discretion. Any price change will immediately apply to Orders placed after 
this change. For already subscribed Services, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a notice of thirty (30) calendar days via email.
Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the opportunity, for thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the concerned Services without incurring penalties. 
This termination can be carried out either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. 
In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered as having accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option 
of termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. 
In such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system,
which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of a dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, yearly, or other periodicity) as well as the 
timing (upon order or after delivery) vary depending on the Service concerned. Billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer 
validated by the CLIENT and the Service Provider. Any period started is due pro-rata for the period. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these conditions before placing an order. 
Following the payment of each invoice, the Service Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt. 

The CLIENT explicitly accepts the receipt of invoices electronically, these being sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. 
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with current legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and late payment

Unless the CLIENT in good faith disputes any part of the invoice, in the event of non-payment or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. Late payment penalties will be immediately due the day after the due date, calculated on the basis of an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. Any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the sums due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a default payment notification by email, will automatically trigger without further notification or formality:

- The immediate demand for all remaining sums owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- The right for the Service Provider to immediately and without notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid),
to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

In addition, in case of late or default payment, professional clients are required to pay a flat-rate compensation of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, 
without prejudice to the right of the Provider to demand additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this flat-rate amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute relating to the billing or specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CUSTOMER Service via the CLIENT's management interface, 
within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of issue of the invoice. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any possible future dispute of the invoice,
be required to pay the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event that a billing error is identified, the Provider reserves the right to make necessary adjustments on the relevant invoices, in compliance with applicable statute of limitations.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to meet the Service Levels outlined in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement gives the CLIENT the right to apply penalties.
The application of penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event. 
In the case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty will be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated based on the non-compliant reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot
exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned in the month's invoice. When the application of penalties is requested by the CLIENT, the payment of these penalties by the Service Provider will constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages concerning the incidents causing the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by the SLA of the Service considered over the calculation period and the observed availability of the service considered over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
In any event, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned in the invoice for the month. Furthermore, penalties always constitute a flat-rate and final compensation for damages concerning the incidents that led to the penalties, these penalties having a liberating character.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit for the Regular Service amount the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for whatever reason, the Service Provider will pay the balance to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination at will

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month has elapsed following the activation of the Contract.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Service Provider up to the effective 
date of termination will be invoiced in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay 
the remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

In the event of non-compliance by one of the parties with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party 
a formal notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, granting them a period of thirty (30) working days from the receipt of the notification to correct the situation.
If, after this period, the party at fault has not rectified their breach, the aggrieved party has the right to terminate the Contract by sending a new notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the offending party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach involves the responsibility of the party initiating this process. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not failed in its commitments, the party initiating the termination procedure would be obliged to compensate for the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:
1. In the event of the other party's bankruptcy, unless the bankruptcy administrator opts to continue the Contract within the legal deadline.

3. The non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a case of force majeure.
4. A change in circumstances unforeseen at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.

with the end CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include an obligation of reversibility (that is, assistance to the Client so that they can migrate their system 
to another Service Provider) except for the provision to the CLIENT by the Service Provider of the technical interface and APIs.
allowing the CLIENT to save and retrieve their data, including notably the configuration data of the platforms 
via one of the following technical modalities at the CLIENT's choice: the provision of files in one or more 
documented and exploitable formats outside of the service provided by the Provider or via the implementation of technical interfaces allowing 
access to data according to a documented and exploitable schema (API).

The CLIENT, the sole master of their System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation as needed 
(which implies, notably, that they establish rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of 
Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT needs an additional service, the Provider can propose a 
consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

under private law or public law, having subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering in compliance

## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider commits to providing the defined Services to the CLIENT, specifying the scope, the terms of execution of the Services, and the associated financial terms. The CLIENT engages in this contract on their own behalf.
The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU), 
which the CLIENT declares to have previously reviewed, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Though the CLIENT operates as a professional,
it is highly recommended that they seek the expertise of a specialist in IT and networks before agreeing to these terms.
This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection 
of the proposed work units' characteristics and the determination of the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party.

Les Parties restent individuellement responsables de leurs actions, déclarations, engagements, services, produits et des actions de leur personnel.

Dans l'éventualité où une disposition du Contrat se révèle invalide en vertu de la législation applicable ou d'une décision de justice irrévocable, 
cette disposition sera considérée comme non écrite. Cette invalidité n'affectera pas la validité globale du Contrat ni la force des autres dispositions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. 
As part of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Provider with all the data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. 
This data includes, but is not limited to, the email address, identity and contact information,
ainsi que les détails bancaires pertinents. Le CLIENT garantit l'exactitude, la fiabilité et la mise à jour de ces informations pour toute la durée du Contrat.

Dans l'éventualité où le Compte CLIENT serait établi ou administré par un tiers agissant en représentation du CLIENT, 
ce tiers doit attester et assurer au Prestataire qu'il détient l'autorité et la capacité juridiques nécessaires pour agir au nom du CLIENT et l'engager conformément aux dispositions d'un contrat.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Before the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify 
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents
to substantiate the information communicated. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or proceed with deactivation
of the CLIENT Account if the information is considered incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT gains the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, 
orders can be placed through the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account, 
including securing the authentication methods (credentials, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves, and entails their full and complete acceptance of the terms of the Contract.
The terms and availability of the ordered Services vary depending on the type of required Service. Some Services will only be available after
que le Prestataire aura reçu le paiement intégral du CLIENT. Il incombe donc au CLIENT de vérifier que les conditions de fourniture des Services répondent à ses exigences.

Les documents constitutifs du Contrat se complètent et s'interprètent de manière cohérente. Néanmoins, en cas de contradiction ou de divergences entre eux, la prééminence 
sera accordée aux documents selon l'ordre dans lequel ils ont été énumérés. Les annexes du Contrat, qui détaillent techniquement les Prestations, ne sauraient contredire 
les principes établis dans le corps principal du Contrat. Leur rôle est d'apporter une précision technique sans remettre en cause les dispositions générales du document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Conditions of Sale and Use (GCSU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise stipulated
in the Special Conditions that would provide for a fixed term.
Termination of the Contract is only possible in accordance with the terms specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete retrieval of their data stored under the relevant Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article on "Data Retrieval and Deletion."

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to settle the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services as per the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to and use of these services are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated appendices.
## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them later.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is subject to prior agreement between the parties following a concerted evaluation.

## 10. Terms of Service Use

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT undertakes to place orders and use the Services strictly in accordance with the applicable terms of use.
The use of the Services must be done responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT commits to familiarizing themselves with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU) in force and to adhering to all the guidelines provided at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are obligated, before any use
par ces derniers, de leur faire connaître et accepter les conditions d'utilisation actuelles. Le CLIENT assure ainsi le Prestataire du respect intégral 
de ces conditions par les tiers concernés.

### 10.2. Choice of Services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT agrees to carefully review the current Terms of Use, 
as well as to analyze in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, in order to select Services and characteristics 
that precisely meet its needs and those of the third parties using the Services on its behalf or for its account.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted 
through the use of the Services. For any request for information related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about changes that may occur, particularly when new Orders are issued.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT, at their own expense and responsibility, maintains an adequate remote connection 
(such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may encounter technical issues 
and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures implemented by the Provider within the scope of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators 
(including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.),
ni des répercussions éventuelles de ces dysfonctionnements, en particulier lorsqu'ils conduisent à une indisponibilité ou à une interruption des Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the credentials and passwords necessary 
to access and use the Services. It must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences 
resulting from the loss, disclosure, misuse, or unauthorized use of the authentication methods assigned to users.

Under no circumstances can the responsibility of the Service Provider be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to notify the Service Provider without delay
in case of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means, and to immediately initiate the replacement or reset procedures for these means.

### 10.5. Content

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any form of access to this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned content.

Similarly, it does not ensure dedicated backup of the content stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures for backing up their content to protect against any risk of loss or damage, whatever the reason, notably through the use of the appropriate units of work available in the Provider's catalog.
The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. 
The use of illegal content (such as broadcasting, publishing, storing, or transmitting content that glorifies crime, 
incites hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violates 
the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited. 

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of Services, the deactivation of the CLIENT's account, 
or even the termination of the Contract to the CLIENT's sole detriment. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to undertake legal proceedings or to claim damages for any harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules
The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources, which may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services, including but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack originating from the provided resources, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. Any form of SPAM or similar spamming practices;
4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in cases of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, the Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Digital Economy Confidence Act (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without notice, in the event of a critical situation or to prevent the illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, 
an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Provider's liability.
The Service Provider strives, as far as possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT stays informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of breach of obligations by the CLIENT, these suspensions will be without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are solely due to a fault of the Service Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of services
The Provider reserves the right to make any modifications to the Services at its discretion, including the addition, modification, or deletion of ranges, options, features, as well as performance improvements. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of Service updates, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes can also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following changes to third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a performance downgrade —, the CLIENT has the right to terminate the concerned Service. To do so, they must send a termination notice 
by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt request, within sixty (60) days following the implementation of the change.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentations, and others — remain the exclusive property 
of the Provider or its assigns. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, 
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, 
apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all the necessary permissions and rights for the elements
et contenus (données, logiciels, applications, systèmes, sites web, etc.) qu'il choisit d'utiliser ou d'exploiter dans le cadre des Services.

Le CLIENT, ainsi que ses Utilisateurs, restent les propriétaires de leurs contenus. Le Prestataire s'engage à ne pas exploiter ces contenus 
à d'autres fins que celles stipulées dans le contrat. Conformément aux lois en vigueur, le CLIENT est tenu de ne pas décompiler les logiciels, 
codes et algorithmes mis à disposition dans le cadre des Services, y compris pour des tentatives de rétro-ingénierie, sauf autorisation légale 
explicite permettant de contourner cette restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's specific activities, the Provider 
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.
It is the responsibility of the CLIENT, if they intend to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside of European borders, to ensure that such use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use items, as well as U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by U.S. legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or legal entities from these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including the CLIENT's solvency and potential presence on sanction lists
on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the Directorate General of the Treasury, may be conducted. Following these checks, the Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party Products supplied within the framework of the Services. These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, or stability problems. The Provider offers no warranty related to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. It is particularly prohibited for the CLIENT to decompile,
to gain access to the source codes, or to reinstall Third-Party Products software or systems on other infrastructures.
The responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for specific needs and goals,
while adhering to the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, its non-renewal,
interruption of Services by the CLIENT, violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain updating or reinstallation operations,
results in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements)
that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, distributed, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the scope of the Services,
including any potential backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, either directly or via a specifically appointed external auditor, penetration tests on the Services provided
(hereinafter referred to as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be conducted after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved
in the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, and their subcontractors if applicable.
These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior consent of the users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor,
resuming the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring the auditor's compliance with these conditions, acting under the CLIENT's responsibility. Penetration Tests must not under any circumstances:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or those not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in case of an incident.
It should be noted that mechanisms for protection against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, which may result in temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any parties affected by this unavailability. At the end of the Intrusion Tests, an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of the discovery of vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written authorization of the Provider. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration
The Parties acknowledge being subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they undertake to share any information and document likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and warrants having the authority and capacity necessary to conclude the Contract and to fulfill their respective obligations. The CLIENT and the Service Provider declare and warrant, in particular, that they have all the necessary authorizations, skills, and knowledge (especially technical) to respectively use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Liability of the Service Provider

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Service Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for
any damages arising from the non-compliance with these commitments. As a result, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action in this regard.
If no service level agreement is applicable, the maximum compensation attributable to the Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation claim.

**Disclaimer of Liability:** The Provider's liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Improper use of the services contrary to the terms of the Agreement;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or negligence by the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as business losses, loss of orders, decreased activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, notably due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, third-party legal action, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or improper or fraudulent use of user access credentials attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;

## 13. Force majeure

The performance of any obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its execution is prevented by a force majeure event as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time the invoice is issued, in accordance with the conditions agreed 
upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing schedules for its
Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing modality. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them at the time of placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant taxes (excluding the Service Provider’s income taxes) will be added to the billed amount. This additional imposition does not constitute a price modification in the sense of the article dedicated to the conditions for tariff revision.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of Services also includes expenses related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights for the tools, software, and operating systems used by the Service Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and settle any necessary licenses or usage rights for the content they use through the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used for calculating these prices are available on the Provider's website.
It is recommended that the CLIENT consult this information before confirming their order. Any unit of measurement started is due in its entirety,
even if it is not fully consumed. Furthermore, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any price modification will apply immediately to Orders placed after
this modification. For Services that have already been subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.
Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the option, within thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the concerned Services without incurring any penalties.
This termination can be carried out either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. 
If termination does not occur within this period, the CLIENT will be considered to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option for penalty-free termination 
is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified 
in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

Billing for the Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, 

who is considered reliable and authoritative in the event of a dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annual, or other periodicity) as well as the timing (upon order or after delivery) differ according to the Service concerned. The billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Service Provider. Any period commenced is due on a pro-rata basis. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize themselves with these conditions before placing an order. Upon payment of each invoice, the Service Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the legal requirements in force.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment
Except for a good faith dispute by the CLIENT concerning all or part of the invoice, in the event of default or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. late payment penalties will become immediately due the day after the due date, calculated at an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or failure in payment (even partial) of the amounts owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after the sending of a default notice by email, will automatically and without further notice or formality result in:

- the immediate due date of all amounts remaining owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- the right for the Provider to immediately and without notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for),
to refuse any new Order or Service renewal, and to unilaterally terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

Furthermore, in the event of late or non-payment, professional clients are required to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for collection fees, 
without prejudice to the right of the Service Provider to demand additional compensation, upon presentation of evidence, if the incurred collection fees exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute related to billing or service specifics must be submitted to the Service Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT's management Interface, 
within a maximum of one (1) month from the invoice issuance date. After this period, the CLIENT remains liable, despite any future possible dispute of the invoice,
required to settle the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event of a billing error, the Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments to the affected invoices, within the applicable prescription periods.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Non-compliance with the Service Levels specified in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement grants the CLIENT the right to apply penalties.
Penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event.
In the case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty shall be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated based on the unmet reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot
exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned for the invoice of the month. When the penalties are requested by the CLIENT, the payment 
of these penalties by the Provider will constitute a lump-sum and definitive compensation for damages regarding the incidents that caused the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by the Service's SLA over the calculation period and the observed availability of the service over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned from the invoice of the month. Furthermore, the penalties always constitute a flat-rate and final compensation for damages regarding the incidents that gave rise to the penalties, and these penalties are of a liberative nature.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit of the amount of the Regular Service for the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for any reason, the Provider will pay the balance to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1 Termination for convenience

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, after a period of one (1) month following the activation of the Contract.
To do this, they must notify their resolution by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Service Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. Termination takes effect at the end of this period. Services provided by the Service Provider up to the effective date of termination will be billed in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obliged to pay the remaining sums due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In the event of non-compliance by one of the parties with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, granting them a period of thirty (30) working days from the receipt of the notification to remedy the situation.
If, after this period, the offending party has not corrected its breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to terminate the Contract by sending a new notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the offending party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the injuries suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the responsibility of the party initiating this process. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has not, in fact, failed in its obligations, the party that initiated the termination process will be required to compensate for the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without cause

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

3. Non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a force majeure event.
4. An unexpected change in circumstances at the time of the Contract's signing, significantly altering its economic balance.

with the CLIENT final, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (i.e., assistance to the Client for migrating their system
to another Provider) except for the provision of the technical interface and APIs to the CLIENT by the Provider
allowing the CLIENT to save and retrieve its data, including, in particular, platform configuration data, through one of the following technical methods of the CLIENT's choice: providing files in one or more documented and usable formats outside the service provided by the Service Provider, or by setting up technical interfaces allowing access to the data according to a documented and usable schema (API).

The CLIENT, as the sole master of its System, must make every effort to facilitate this operation as needed (which implies, in particular, that they establish rigorous documentation for this purpose) and develop Reversibility plans. If the CLIENT requires additional service, the Service Provider may offer advisory services in this regard as part of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 20. Assignment of the contract
The Parties agree that the Contract is concluded intuitu personae. Therefore, neither Party may assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, especially in the event of a change of control (as defined in articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset contribution.

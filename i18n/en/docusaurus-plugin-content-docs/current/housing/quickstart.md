   - Desired type of hosting (shared at 'U' level or dedicated per rack).
   - Quantity and characteristics of the equipment (size, weight, power consumption, etc.).

## Step 2: Prepare Your Equipment

- Ensure your equipment meets the technical constraints:
  - Size in rack units (U).
  - Maximum weight per 'U' (25kg for shared, up to 1000kg for a dedicated rack).
  - Power consumption (150W to 3Kw depending on the subscribed option).
## Step 3: Configure Network Connectivity

1. Select the required port type:
   - Copper 1Gbps.
   - Fiber 1Gbps or 10Gbps.
2. Add connectivity options in Meet Me Room if necessary for operator integration.

## Step 4: Activate Hands & Eyes Services

If needed, request technical assistance to:
- Install your equipment.

- Perform occasional actions (reboot, photos, etc.).

## Step 5: Validate the Installation

Once your equipment is installed, verify their connectivity and proper functioning directly through the Cloud Temple console or in coordination with support.

This **Quickstart Housing** guide assists you in quickly getting started with Cloud Temple's physical hosting offer. It covers the essential steps to make a hosting request, set up your equipment, and benefit from additional services.

## Step 1: Make a hosting request

1. Access the Cloud Temple console.
2. Open a service file by providing:
   - Your organization's name.
   - Contact details (email and phone).
   - Desired type of hosting (shared by 'U' or dedicated by rack).
   - Quantity and characteristics of the equipment (size, weight, consumption, etc.).

## Step 2: Prepare your equipment

- Ensure your equipment meets the technical constraints:
  - Size in rack units (U).
  - Maximum weight per 'U' (25kg for shared, up to 1000kg for a dedicated rack).
  - Power consumption (150W to 3Kw depending on the option subscribed).
## Step 3: Configure Network Connectivity

1. Select the required port type:
   - 1Gbps Copper.
   - 1Gbps or 10Gbps Fiber.
2. Add Meet Me Room connectivity options if necessary for operator integration.

## Step 4: Activate Hands & Eyes Services

If needed, request technical assistance to:
- Install your equipment.
- Configure the wiring.
- Perform occasional actions (reboot, photos, etc.).

## Step 5: Validate the Installation

Once your equipment is installed, verify their connectivity and proper functioning directly via the Cloud Temple console or in coordination with support.
